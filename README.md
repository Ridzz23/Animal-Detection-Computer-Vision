# Automated scarecrow

This python program is built with the aim to develop an automated scarecrow. Currently, the computer vision model is able to take an image as input, process the image and identify all the objects in the image with a certain confidence level. If the confidence of the prediction is more than 10% and the object detected is a bird then a message is displayed.
